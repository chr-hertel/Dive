Dive ORM Framework
===

Just another ORM implementation... Just another? No, not really...
Okay, it uses active record pattern, as many others too. But there some things are different.

It components are loose coupled, introduced by interfaces, clean, maintainable and extensible.

Concepts behind
---
 * PDO connector based
 * Active record pattern
 * Intelligent relation loading similar to the [NotORM]: https://github.com/vrana/notorm (see also: [Doctrine 2 versus NotORM]: http://www.notorm.com/static/doctrine2-notorm/)
 * Intelligent relation handling
   Two tables with a relation to each other sharing the same relation instance, so both know of each other, which is different to all ORM implementations I know.

Requires
---
 * PHP 5.3 or greater (UnitTests need 5.3.2)
 * Symfony's EventDispatcher (https://github.com/symfony/EventDispatcher)

### Milestone Query building (in progress)
 * Support of select/from/left join/where/where in/where not in/group by/having/order by/limit/offset/distinct/for update
 * Deletes through select queries (select query used as sub-query)
 * Update queries

### Milestone Query result hydration (in progress)
 * fetch as object (\Dive\Record)
 * fetch as objects (\Dive\Collection\RecordCollection)
 * fetch as single array
 * fetch as array
 * fetch as single scalar
 * fetch as scalars
 * error handling

### Milestone intelligent Relation/Reference management using repositories as registers
 * repositories that hold already loading records
 * relations knows which records belongs to each other

### Milestone UnitOfWork for saving / deleting object graphs
 * change set processing by object graph and corresponding relations
 * database type validation
 * abstraction of foreign key constraints by Dive

### First alpha release
